#Another Git Training

lets create a folder to start a git repository

```bash
mkdir git-training
```

we should initialize the repository in the created folder

```bash
git init
```

to add a remote server where to upload your current repository status

```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/user/repo.git
# Set a new remote

git remote -v
# Verify new remote
```
